My project is about the third Mobile Legends World Championship.
The Team table stores the names of all teams and the nicknames of all players on that team.
The Game table stores general information about the team matchups, such as the name of the first team, the name of the second team, at what stage of the tournament the match took place, who won, etc.
The Hero table stores information about all the heroes in the game, such as the hero's name, class, etc.
The Item table stores information about all the items in the game.
The TeamStatistics table stores information about each game in the matchups from the perspective of each team (team statistics).
The PlayerStatistics table stores almost the same information as the TeamStatistics table, but from the perspective of each player (player statistics).
